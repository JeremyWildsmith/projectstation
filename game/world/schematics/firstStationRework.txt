Colour Coding Scheme:
	Power:
		Red   - Local power network, driven by power generation device (Generator, Solor panels)
		Green - Global Power Network, driven by capacitors
		Blue  - Local Power Network, driven by global power network
	
	Network:
		White  - Primary Network, connects to global network
